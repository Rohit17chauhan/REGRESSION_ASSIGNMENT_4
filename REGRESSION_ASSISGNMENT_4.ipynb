A larger λ increases the penalty, shrinking more coefficients to zero, which can help prevent overfitting but may lead to underfitting if λ is too large. Choosing the right λ balances the model’s complexity and generalization ability, often found through cross-validation.\\n\\nMaximum Number of Iterations: This parameter sets the limit for how many iterations the optimization algorithm will run. If the algorithm does not converge within the default number of iterations, increasing this value may help the model fully optimize, especially in large datasets. If the model stops too early, it may return suboptimal solutions.\\n\\nTolerance for Optimization: This defines how precise the solution needs to be before the optimization stops. A smaller tolerance means the optimization will run longer, potentially leading to a more accurate result. A larger tolerance will make the optimization stop earlier, speeding up the process but potentially sacrificing precision.

If the data is already normalized and centered, you can set it to exclude the intercept.\\n\\nNormalization or Standardization: Since Lasso penalizes based on the size of the coefficients, normalizing the features is important if they are on different scales.
